/**
 * NAVICORE OS part pages: one typed entry per part of the NAVICORE OS Master Reference (Parts 01-52).
 *
 * Source of truth: the Master Reference. Rules followed in this file:
 *  - Only functions, flows and facts that appear in the guide. Nothing invented: no customers,
 *    numbers, prices, testimonials, awards or certifications.
 *  - The full checklist for each part comes from spec-scope.generated.ts (extracted by script,
 *    never retyped). Anything the founder has not confirmed is listed in `withhold` and `todos`.
 *  - A flow marked "guide" has its order stated in the guide. A flow marked "composed" is our
 *    arrangement of the guide's listed functions into a plain-language sequence; the founder
 *    should confirm those sequences (see FOUNDER-CHECKLIST.md).
 *  - Part 00 of the guide (positioning and build sequencing) is internal; it informs the home
 *    page and the status labels but has no page of its own. The site therefore has 52 part
 *    pages, Parts 01-52.
 *  - Text lives under copy.en so a Bangla translation can be added as copy.bn later.
